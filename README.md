### Introduction
This page provides resources related to the S-100 based Product Specifications as prioritized in the [Annex 2 of the S-100 Roadmap](https://iho.int/uploads/user/About%20IHO/Council/S-100_ImplementationStrategy/S-100%20Roadmap_Annex_2_v2.0_July2022.pdf). In addition to the Product Specifications themselves, Test Datasets and information about related S-100 testbed is provided. It is intended to support system developers in implementting S-100 based Product Specifications and provide a central location to provide feedback on their different components.

### Test Datasets
S-164 *- IHO Test Data Sets in ECDIS* have been produced to fulfil the requirement for a set of data sets necessary to accomplish all ECDIS testing requirements as outlined in the IEC 61174 standard.  The Test Data Sets (TDS) are published as IHO Publication S-164 and consist of numerous data sets required for testing as well as the TDS Instruction Manual (TIM).  The TIM provides supporting documentation about the organization, understanding, and use of the ENC TDS and is intended to be used along with the data sets included in the TDS. 

S-164 can be found at the following link: (*[In development](https://github.com/iho-ohi/S-164-Sub-Group)*) 

The following are links to various test data sets that are produced by the individual Project Teams as well as various IHO Member States in support of S-100 Implementation.

### Test Framework

A Test Framework has been developed to facilitate testing of S-100. This sets out a number of testing objectives to support testbeds in creating more detailed test materials. It includes some example user stories and where relevant references to associated Test Datasets. Feedback is welcome on the Test Framework. [In preparation](https://iho-ohi.github.io/S100Resources/)
