### Introduction
This page provides resources related to the S-100 based Product Specifications as prioritized in the [Annex 2 of the S-100 Roadmap](https://iho.int/uploads/user/About%20IHO/Council/S-100_ImplementationStrategy/S-100%20Roadmap_Annex_2_v2.0_July2022.pdf). In addition to the Product Specifications themselves, Test Datasets and information about related S-100 testbed is provided. It is intended to support system developers in implementting S-100 based Product Specifications and provide a central location to provide feedback on their different components.

## Test Datasets
S-164 *- IHO Test Data Sets in ECDIS* have been produced to fulfil the requirement for a set of data sets necessary to accomplish all ECDIS testing requirements as outlined in the IEC 61174 standard.  The Test Data Sets (TDS) are published as IHO Publication S-164 and consist of numerous data sets required for testing as well as the TDS Instruction Manual (TIM).  The TIM provides supporting documentation about the organization, understanding, and use of the ENC TDS and is intended to be used along with the data sets included in the TDS. 

S-164 can be found at the following link:
